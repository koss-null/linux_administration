-brand-new bastardization algorithm, which looks more realistic while being somehow even nastier. It is less likely to give you long sequences of the same block, which was pointed out as the biggest flaw in 0.37 
-some bugfixes: strcpy->strncpy, the play=1 issue. Thanks to all who have reported them!

--0.37, first public release
"Bas" part:
-"upper profile analysis" for the seven blocks
-column multipliers: each column has its "weight" based on the dots' height

"Tet" part:
-introduced "drop", "pause" and "quit" commands
-Now Petris/Bastet correctly restores cursor on exit with ctrl-C
